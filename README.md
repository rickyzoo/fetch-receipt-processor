# Receipt Processor

Welcome to **Receipt Processor**! This local Dockerized application written in Python (using FastAPI) processes Receipt information represented in JSON and returns the number of points earned according to your purchase. This project completes the Take-home portion of the Backend Engineer role at Fetch Rewards, _America's Rewards App_.

## Setup

## Python-to-Golang

While Go is the explicitly stated backend language of choice at Fetch Rewards, I come with limited (but existing) Go experience. I have a bit of a data science background from my time in undergrad and about a year-and-a-half worth of Full-stack software development experience. Python was the main language I programmed in throughout these experiences. In order to properly capture my engineering and programming knowledge I chose to complete this project using Python. However, detailed below is what I would do (represented in pseudo-pseudo code) if I were to refactor my solution from Python to Go.
